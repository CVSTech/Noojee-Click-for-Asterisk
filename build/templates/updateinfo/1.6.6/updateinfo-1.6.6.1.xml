<h1>Release notes</h1>
<p>Version 1.6.6.1</p>
Fixed a bug in the render engine that was causing Firefox 4.0 to hang all too frequently.
Removed the use of a noojeeClicTop span as this wasn't actually necessary.
Tested for regression in Firefox 3.x and 4.0 - all good.
Tweaked the rendering of the noojee click button so that it bottom aligns its self and so that its background was transparent (rather than white).
Modified the Aastra auto-answer header based on feedback from users.
