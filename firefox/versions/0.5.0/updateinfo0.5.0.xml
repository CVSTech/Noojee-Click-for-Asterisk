<h1>Release notes</h1>
<p>Version 0.5.0
This release includes a number of enhancements as well as a number of bug fixes.
<b>Enhancements</b>
Added context menus (right click) to allow:
* Dialing selected text
* Adding a dial pattern based on selected text
* Dialing a number differently

Now sets the 'callerid' to the phone number being dialled so it is displayed on the users handset.
Added experimental support for Noojee Vision integration.
Changed the default of 'Auto Answer' to true, as most people should use auto answer.
Added abiliy to set the technology in the extension (defaults to SIP/).
You can use this to set your home or mobile (cell) as the extension by setting Local/XXXXXXX where XXXXXX is your mobile or home number.
Be careful as when using Local/ both ends ring simultaneously so you need to answer you moble quickly.

<b>Bug Fixes</b>
Fixed issue with dialing from clipboard which wasn't adding the international prefix when needed.
Renamed 'log' to 'njlog' to avoid conflicts with other extensions.
Resolved issue with some boolean preferences causing Noojee Click to start if no default value specified.
Removed bug where 'context' was not being initialized under some circumstances.
Fixed a bug where the 'channel' was being passed twice during the dial.
Fixed a bug where the Dial Prefix was being ignored.

<b>Known Issues </b>
When adding a dial pattern which is an extended version of an existing pattern the new pattern doesn't take affect immediately. 
You need to refresh the page using the browsers 'refresh' button.
I still can't get the help button to display help in an external web browser so I've disabled it.
