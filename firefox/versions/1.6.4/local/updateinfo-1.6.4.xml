<h1>Release notes</h1>
<p>Version 1.6.4</p>
<p>Fixed a bug where the configuration preferences were not saving under windows.
So much for cross platform ; ;lt; </p>
Added a small patch designed to fix a problem where the callerid function is called with the incorrect case.
This may fix the problem with caller id not being set that some users have reported.

<p>If you have feature requests or installation/configuration problems post them at http://forums.noojee.com.au</p>
